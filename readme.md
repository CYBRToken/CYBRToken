# About CYBRToken

CYBR Tokens are designed to incentivize and provide 
functionality for the three-pronged CYBR solution. 
Subscription services and the provision of blockchain related services 
will be solely transacted utilizing CYBR Tokens. 
Rewards for CYBR community members will be a determined allocation of CYBR Tokens. 
CYBR is a standard ERC20 smart contract-based to- ken running 
on the Ethereum network and is implemented 
within the business logic set forth by the Companyâ€™s developers.

The CYBR utility token is redeemable for usage with BlindSpot 
and global threat intelligence feeds. The CYBR initiative provides 
protection to individual networks, SMEs and large-scale enterprise users. 
Intelligence feeds are based on risk scores; packaged in a series of 
products/services and delivered via a subscription model which can provide:

- Assessed zero-day global threat feeds o Json, CSV and XML formats 
  - Utilizing IP tables firewall rules
  - Magento, Wordpress and related plugins
- Global threat intelligence reports
- Email alerts
- Mobile apps
- API key to access CYBR via apps/dapps

Data feeds will be based on number of user licenses, to be purchased 
on a yearly-based subscription model. Special needs assessments, customized solutions, 
or any appliance applications can be purchased at an additional cost.

The CYBR business model is simple: a subscription-based value-added service 
with recurring revenues. The company has identified a number of ancillary 
revenue streams, ranging from customized packages to the sale of propriety 
and modded hardware devices. However, it should be noted that the potent
solution that is BlindSpot will drive our quest for adoption.
