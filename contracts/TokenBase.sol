///@title CYBRToken Base Contract
///@author Binod Nirvan
///@notice Cyber Security Ecosystem Tokens are designed to incentivize and provide
///functionality for the three-pronged CYBR solution.
///Subscription services and the provision of blockchain related services
///will be solely transacted utilizing Cyber Security Ecosystem Tokens.
///Rewards for CYBR community members will be a determined allocation of Cyber Security Ecosystem Tokens.
///CYBR is a standard ERC20 smart contract-based to- ken running
///on the Ethereum network and is implemented
///within the business logic set forth by the Companyâ€™s developers.
///&nbsp;
///The CYBR utility token is redeemable for usage with BlindSpot
///and global threat intelligence feeds. The CYBR initiative provides
///protection to individual networks, SMEs and large-scale enterprise users.
///Intelligence feeds are based on risk scores; packaged in a series of
///products/services and delivered via a subscription model which can provide:
///&nbsp;
///- Assessed zero-day global threat feeds o Json, CSV and XML formats
///  - Utilizing IP tables firewall rules
///  - Magento, Wordpress and related plugins
///- Global threat intelligence reports
///- Email alerts
///- Mobile apps
///- API key to access CYBR via apps/dapps
///&nbsp;
///Data feeds will be based on number of user licenses, to be purchased
///on a yearly-based subscription model. Special needs assessments, customized solutions,
///or any appliance applications can be purchased at an additional cost.
///&nbsp;
///The CYBR business model is simple: a subscription-based value-added service
///with recurring revenues. The company has identified a number of ancillary
///revenue streams, ranging from customized packages to the sale of propriety
///and modded hardware devices. However, it should be noted that the potent
///solution that is BlindSpot will drive our quest for adoption.
